# Gold Weekly Workshop Series - Azure Functions
![Intro](./images/intro.jpg)

**Azure Functions** is a serverless compute service that lets you run event-triggered code without having to explicitly provision or manage infrastructure. It allows you to implement your system's logic into readily-available blocks of code called "functions". Also it is cost effective, auto scalable and easy deployable.
